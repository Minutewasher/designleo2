            <p>Crystal PvP, commonly known as cpvp, is a form of combat using end crystals to kill opponents, prevalent on 2b2t and other such servers, on which crystal PvP is the primary form of combat. As crystals do heavy damage to both health and armor, it has become more efficient than the standard sword and bow combat. This form of combat evolved from the suicide bombing meta used during the Rusher War in mid-2016, during which end crystals were first used as weapons in combat. Hacked clients have introduced Crystal Autoplace Crystal Aura to fit this method of combat in which the player will automatically place and detonate nearby Crystals, as well as a hack that shows safe spots to stand when crystaling.</p>
